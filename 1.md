# Move Zeroes
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Use 2 pointers, one to zeros other to no-zeros iterate over the array and exchange  this values

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
We will iterate over the array from start to end.
during this iteration we will keep trak from the position of the nearest-beggining zeros and another pointer witch will point towards the position of the next no-zero.
No-zero pointer will always be >= to zero pointer, so if zero pointer finds a zero, the no-zero pointer will increment until it finds a no-zero value. When this happend, we will exchange the values an increment the zero pointer until finds another zero.
This process will continue until one of the pointers reaches the length of the array

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
Both pointers never reset or decrese, and they only grow by a fixed ammount (1), the worst scenario would be when there are a zero at the beggining and a no-zero close to the end. And in this case the no-zero pointer will take $$n$$ steps and then the zero pointer also is going to take $$n$$ steps.
At the end we will have a complexity of $$O(n)$$ 

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
we only declare 2 numbers irrespective of the array length, so the space complexity is constant $$O(1)$$
