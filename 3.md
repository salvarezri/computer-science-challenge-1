# Critical Connections in a Network

There are n servers numbered from 0 to n - 1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a connection between servers ai and bi. Any server can reach other servers directly or indirectly through the network.

A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some servers unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
We will start to search for cycles. if we find a connection inside a cycle, this conection isn't critical, so we can remove it from the list of connections.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
similar to TarjanÂ´s algorithm, we will perfom a DFS into the graph and we will have a rank wich will try to represent the deep on the DFS.

So we follow a path and came to a node with rank $$a$$. when we visit his neighbours we notice that it has a rank $$b$$ where $$b<a$$. In this point we realice, we are in a loop, so we just need to deleet the connections of this loop.

As the graph is fully connected, when the DFS proccess ends, on the array with connections will only remain the critical ones. 

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
Givven $$n$$ servers and $$m$$ connections:
1) **creating the graph:** we iterate over all conections to create the structure of the graph. $$O(m)$$.
2) **DFS:** The main structure of the algorithm is DFS and we make a fixed ammount of extra operations to delete the none crytical conections and to check and update the rank of the nodes, so overall the complexity of this part is the complexity of DFS, again, $$O(m+n)$$.

Overall the space comlexity is $$O(n+m)$$.

But as the graph is fully conected, m>=n will always be true.

$$O(m)$$

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
Givven $$n$$ servers and $$m$$ connections:
1) **Graph:** Based on a dictionary, has the same information of the array arranged in a diferent structure so it is $$O(m)$$
2) **ranks array** This array will save the rank of every node so it wil take $$O(n)$$.

Overall the space comlexity is $$O(n+m)$$.

But as the graph is fully conected, m>=n will always be true.

$$O(m)$$
