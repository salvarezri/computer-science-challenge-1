# Reverse Odd Levels of Binary Tree
Given the root of a perfect binary tree, reverse the node values at each odd level of the tree.

For example, suppose the node values at level 3 are [2,1,3,4,7,11,29,18], then it should become [18,29,11,7,4,3,1,2].

Return the root of the reversed tree.

* A binary tree is perfect if all parent nodes have two children and all leaves are on the same level.

* The level of a node is the number of edges along the path between it and the root node.

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Walk through the levels of the tre horizontaly using BFS and reverse the values of all the level if is odd

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
First make a basic structure fro a BFS using a Queue and a while loop.

As in BFS, each loop execution goes through all nodes from a level in order, if the level is odd we should make: 
1) Store in a array the nodes from the level 
2) collect the values and reverse them
3) reasign the values for each node stored in step 1. 


# Complexity
- ***Time complexity***:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
This measure is hard, but lets brake the algorithm:
1) **BFS**: on this algorithm we check for every node on the tree, so the complexity is $$O(n)$$
2) **Updating values**: We need to iterate over the list of the level nodes. in the worst case (leaves of the tree) we have (n+1)/2 nodes, in complexity of time  $$O(n)$$
3) **When does this happen** But this only hapen on the odd levels. as the tree is complete, the ammount of levels on a tree with n nodes is $$log(n)$$ so we do the second step $$log(n)/2$$ times

Honestly, I dontÂ´n know how the combination of second and thirth part affect the overall coplexity. for the moment I will asume it is negligible so i will only take BFS complexity $$O(n)$$

- ***Space complexity***:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
1) the tree: $$O(n)$$
4) queue to make BFS: max ammount of nodes in the queue on a coplete tree is the ammount of leaves $$(n+1)/2$$ witch means $$O(n)$$ 
2) array for level nodes: $$O(n)$$
3) array for values of the level nodes: $$O(n)$$

the higgest is still $$O(n)$$

            # Move to the next level
            level += 1
